# Context
I chose [p5play](https://p5play.org/) because of their easy to learn codes and the many things that you can do with p5play, they not only give you a [tinker tool](https://editor.p5js.org/) but also a whole list of things that you can learn from their page, from sprites to animations to their unique physics, which i find very cool considering i used to play around with google space a lot when i was little. So I started using their tinker tool and started to learn straight from their page.

## Sprites
In p5play sprites play a major role when animating, when you first animate you want to know what sprite are you animating upon on. i learned that in p5play sprites can be any shape you like for example if you want a circle you can make one yourself. but to start to make one. you need a canvas to do so.

```
function setup() {
	new Canvas(300, 300);
}

function draw() {
	background('green');
}
```
The code above shows a canvas. with width and height of 300. using the function of draw it fills in the color of the canvas in this case i replaced it with the color "green".
