From the fianle steps of leanring our tool i think i can come to an end on what were learning which is sprite animation. I have made a tresting sprite with my own drawing as a tester and i think it turned out pretty well conisdering p5play would only allow animations by frames, like a stop-motion at least.

```
let player
let catman

funtion preload(){

 catman = loadAnimation(["Untitled86_20250112213346.png","Untitled86_20250112213340.png","Untitled86_20250112213336.png", "Untitled86_20250112213328.png", "IMG_2599.png"])
}

function setup(){
 player = new Sprite();

  player.addAni(catman);
}
```
