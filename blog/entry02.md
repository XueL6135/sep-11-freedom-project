 These past few weeks Ive been having an interesting experiment with my tool as im just experimenting with some videos as well as trying them out for myself and changing up some codes to see if theres a limit or extent. [video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=a9HOemx9wk-jo5N2&v=XsTXsHxgWJc&feature=youtu.be) and [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBt_w3SELnw) video one is about the many effects you can do while you press a key. and video 2 is mostly about keyboard control. and you can control the ship using your keys.

this was made possible due to `mouse.pressed` and `world.gravity.y = 5` you can use x but either one works

 by using `s.x = mouse.x` i can make them spawn where ever i want by just clicking on the screen at the same time the .y works too
- i found out that `random(30,100)` is different from what i expected, the comma is the numbers between 30 and 100 and it can be placed if you want anything to spawn between that number either it can be the x-axis or the y-axis.

then there is `sprite.amount` is pretty fun to polay with, if you click on the screen it will show many of one thing with that amount and it will not go over that amount.

see how theres a lot of the poop emojis in one click but not the second?, its alright cause the number of those emojis was the amount that i set the maximum of that amount.
